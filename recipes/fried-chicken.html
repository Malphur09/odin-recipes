    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Crispy fried chicken is a classic comfort food known for its crunchy, golden-brown coating and juicy, flavorful
        meat. Made by seasoning chicken pieces, coating them in a spiced flour mixture, and deep-frying until perfectly
        crisp, this dish delivers a satisfying crunch with every bite. Whether served with sides like mashed potatoes
        and coleslaw or enjoyed on its own, crispy fried chicken is a timeless favorite.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) pounds chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour
            you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and
            shake to coat well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET
            SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but
            not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a
            few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.
        </li>
    </ol>
