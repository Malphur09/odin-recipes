    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make spice mix: Stir together saffron, cinnamon, allspice, lime powder, cardamom, and white pepper in a
            small bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make dish: Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in
            butter until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook over
            medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato purée.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, carrots, cloves, nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and
            reserved spice mix. Cook for about 3 minutes; pour in water and add chicken bouillon cube.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat, and cover the pot. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the
            juices run clear, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently stir in rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and almost dry, about 25 minutes; add
            raisins and a little more hot water, if necessary. Cover and cook until rice grains separate, 5 to 10
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer rice to a large serving platter and arrange chicken on top. Sprinkle with toasted slivered almonds.
